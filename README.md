<h1> Finite Automata Interpreter </h1>
<p> The Finite Automata Interpreter is a Python API that provides support for both deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata. The API includes a visualizer that allows you to draw the automaton graph scheme and view it in a graphical interface. </p>

<h2> Features </h2>
<ul>
<li> Supports deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata </li>
<li> Provides an easy-to-use API for constructing and manipulating automata </li>
<li> Includes a visualizer that draws the automaton graph scheme and allows for interactive exploration of the automaton </li>
<li> Supports input validation against the constructed automaton </li>
